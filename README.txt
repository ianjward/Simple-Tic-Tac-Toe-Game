As this is a prototype there are a few idiosyncrasies and flaws to keep in mind while while using the application.
* Closing the application must be done from the underlying OS, no close button has been added yet.
* In order to select a square the user must click towards the middle of the white space. This is an easy fix but trials with different resolutions are currently being conducted hence this inflexibility.
* The last move of the game does not show until after the dialog box, prompting the user to start a new game, is displayed.
